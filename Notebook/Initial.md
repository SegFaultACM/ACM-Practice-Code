– 2^10 = 1,024 ≈ 10^3, 2^20 = 1,048,576 ≈ 10^6.  
– 32-bit signed integers (int) and 64-bit signed integers (long long) have upper limits of 2^31 −1 ≈ 2×10^9 (safe for up to ≈ 9 decimal digits) and 2^63 −1 ≈ 9×10^18 (safe for up to ≈ 18 decimal digits) respectively.  
– Unsigned integers can be used if only non-negative numbers are required. 32-bit unsigned integers (unsigned int) and 64-bit unsigned integers (unsigned long long) have upper limits of 2^32 − 1 ≈ 4 × 10^9 and 2^64 − 1 ≈ 1.8 × 10^19 respectively.  
– If you need to store integers ≥ 2^64, use the Big Integer technique (Section 5.3).  
– There are n! permutations and 2^n subsets (or combinations) of n elements.  
– The best time complexity of a comparison-based sorting algorithm is Ω(n log2 n).  
– Usually, O(n log2 n) algorithms are sufficient to solve most contest problems.
– The largest input size for typical programming contest problems must be < 1M. Beyond that, the time needed to read the input (the Input/Output routine) will be the bottleneck.  
– A typical year 2013 CPU can process 100M = 10^8 operations in a few seconds.
